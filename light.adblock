! Zelo*s "Light" Blocklist - for a better internet
! ------------------------------------------------
!
! A lightweight blocklist for ad blockers who have
! problems with large lists.
!
! Included lists: 
!   Personal
!
! Blocks:
!    ads, tracking, metrics and telemetry.
!
! This blocklist was designed to avoid false 
! positive domains as much as possible and
! not to block any needed features.
! Maximum blocking with full functionality.
!
! It was compiled from numerous sources, 
! my own blacklist and various whitelists.
! To keep the list as small as possible, 
! dead domains are removed regularly.
!
! It is updated daily and is available in
! the following formats:
!   domains, hosts and adblock.
!   See: https://github.com/Zelo72
!
! Created for purely personal, private use.
! Keep the internet clean!
